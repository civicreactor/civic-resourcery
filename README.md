## Notes

In order to be an easily reproducable environment for everyone, I recommend
using yarn instead of npm for package management and *not* installing tool
dependencies (ie. ionic, cordova, typescript, etc.) other than node and yarn
itself globally (either system-wide or user's ~/.yarn folder).
